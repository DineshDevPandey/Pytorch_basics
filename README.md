# Pytorch_basics

PyTorch is a Python-based scientific computing package that uses the power of graphics processing units. It is also one of the preferred deep learning research platforms built to provide maximum flexibility and speed. It is known for providing two of the most high-level features; namely, tensor computations with strong GPU acceleration support and building deep neural networks on a tape-based autograd systems.
